    "text": "The data for today’s exercises come from the mowater library, the eml dataset. This data are about measurements of the properties of water in the Eagle Mountain Lake reservoir in North Texas.\n\nLoad the mowater library, and then load the eml dataset. In the RMarkdown document, show the commands you use to do this, but not the output of those commands (message=FALSE as an option in the code chunk header is a good way to do this).\n\n\nlibrary(mowateR)\ndata(\"eml\",package=\"mowateR\")\n\n\nNext, inspect the dataset.\n\nHow many variables are there?\nHow many observations are there?\nAre the data already sorted in time order?\nWhat do the variables represent, do you think? You may want to consult the help for the dataset to understand it better, including the units of measurement.\nWhat are the ranges of the values?\nAre there any missing values (NA values)?\n\n\nR variables 35532 observations Already in order by time Depth- depth of the water, Temp- Water temp, DO- Dissolved oxygen in the water, DOsat- dissolved oxygen saturation, pH- pH, Cond- conductivity of the water\n\nThe size of our dataset is rather large for easy (and fast) manipulation. Pare it down by creating a new data frame with only the last \\(500\\) observations in it. This is throwing away a lot of information, and we should be careful any time we do this. But if we try to use all the data, it may be too time-consuming for an in-class exercise.\n\n\ndf &lt;- tail(eml, 500)\n\n\nNow that the data are of a manageable size for visualizing it, plot all of the variables against each other. Try calling plot(eml_small), but replace eml_small with the name of the small data frame you just created. This creates a matrix of pairwise scatterplots.\n(If this takes a very long time, you may have made the mistake of trying to plot the original dataset, which is quite large for this task.)\n\n\nplot(df)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the plot and consider which pairs of variables appear to be linearly related. Choose DO and pH. Make a scatter plot of DO on the y-axis and pH on the x-axis. Which one are you thinking of as the independent variable, and which one are you thinking of as the dependent variable?\n\n\nplot(df$pH, df$DO)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m thinking of pH as the independent variable, though that may be because it’s the one plotted on the x axis.\n\nRun a linear regression by calling lm(DO ~ pH, data=eml_small) where again eml_small is the small data frame. Plot the regression line on the scatter plot using abline on the model that lm returns. If the line doesn’t appear to follow the data, you may have switched the variables (for the plot versus the linear regression).\n\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(DO ~ pH, data=df)\nabline(model)\n# Error in int_abline(a = a, b = b, h = h, v = v, untf = untf, ...): plot.new has not been called yet\n\n\nInvestigate the coefficients and summary statistics of the model that lm gave you. Comment on the coefficient values, significance levels of the coefficients (are they significantly different from \\(0\\)), and \\(R^2\\) values. Does there appear to be a linear relationship between these two variables?\n\n\nsummary(model)\n# \n# Call:\n# lm(formula = DO ~ pH, data = df)\n# \n# Residuals:\n#      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n# -1.83942 -0.41907  0.09877  0.48027  1.29376 \n# \n# Coefficients:\n#             Estimate Std.

You can do this by direct computation if you want (rather than using any specialty R command). Hand-check your work on your plot. Is the predicted value close to the plotted data?\n\n\np &lt;- data.frame(pH=c(7.7))\npoints(x=7.7, y=predict(model,p), col='red', pch=19)\n# Error in plot.xy(xy.coords(x, y), type = type, ...): plot.new has not been called yet\n\nIt should be roughly 3, maybe slightly lower After coding, I find it is 2.87, so the predicted value is incredibly close to what was plotted\n\nDo you trust this model to make a prediction of DO for a pH value of 3? Explain your answer. I trust it to make a decently accurate prediction, though I would probably want more sample values if it is for something highly risky.\nExtra credit: repeat steps 5-7, but for a different pair of variables than the pair you were just working with. Compare the models; does it appear that one pair of variables is more strongly linearly related than the other pair?

The R^2 and R^2 adjusted are pretty close together and the significance levels of the coefficients are pretty close to zero. I think that temp is a dependent variable of depth, however I think it still looks fairly loose because there may be another factor that has an effect, like the date/time."
